            <p>
                Nine noble families fight for control over the lands of Westeros,
                while an ancient enemy returns after being dormant for millennia.
            </p>

                A popular misconception developed among viewers of the show that the showrunners,
                David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, had rushed the making of the final season so that
                they could move on to make a Star Wars project for Disney. While they did have
                several Star Wars movies planned at the time of the airing of Season 8, Benioff
                and Weiss have stated that their plans for the remainder of Game of Thrones (ending
                with Season 8) were already mapped out in 2013, long before Disney approached them.
            </p>

            <p>
                Their Star Wars project was only due to come out in 2022, and since the show
                wrapped filming in 2018, the production timelines were not overlapping.
                The final six episodes took twice as long to produce as a regular ten-episode
                season, so the process wasn’t rushed.
            </p>

            <p>
                After the show aired its final episode, Benioff and Weiss signed a $100 million
                deal with Netflix, which led them to drop the Star Wars project — indicating
                it wasn’t their top priority.
